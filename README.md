## Try to dive deep before asking questions

Knowing when to ask questions is tough. 

Some team leads want you to figure it out on your own and ask a question when you ask a question. 
Some team members don't mind diving deep on a problem if you ask, going from start to finish.
Others don't mind helping, but after giving you some tips "Are you good?"

So who do you go to for help and when do you ask? Once I understand the story, I like to dive deep into the code base for 30 minutes or so, if I'm still stuck on the issue I ask my little Junimo (from Stardew Valley) or any stuffed animal (search for Rubber Duck Debugging) the really detailed question. After I jump through the obvious things and understand why I need help AND still need help understanding a portion. If that helps understand the issue or helps me understand what I'm stuck on, that's great. I'm searching for what the actual problem is. Then the question is who do you ask? 

Lead dev? I need a deep dive into the app for this one
Project Manager about a clarification or "where is this in the app? Do you have examples"? 
QA, can you show me what you mean?
Any dev team member - I understand part of it, but have a few specific questions

But I'll be honest, sometimes I open up a chat window. Start typing my question "Hey, when you have a minute can we chat? I have a question about... because it's doing... " and then I delete it all because that helped enough
