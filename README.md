## Try to dive deep before asking questions

Knowing when to ask questions is tough. 

Some team leads want you to figure it out on your own and ask a question when you ask a question. 
Some team members don't mind diving deep on a problem if you ask, going from start to finish.
Others don't mind helping, but after giving you some tips "Are you good?"

So who do you go to for help and when do you ask? Once I understand the story, I like to dive deep into the code base for 30 minutes or so, if I'm still stuck on the issue I ask my little Junimo (from Stardew Valley) or any stuffed animal (search for Rubber Duck Debugging) the really detailed question. After I jump through the obvious things and understand why I need help AND still need help understanding a portion. If that helps understand the issue or helps me understand what I'm stuck on, that's great. I'm searching for what the actual problem is. Then the question is who do you ask? 

* Lead dev? I need a deep dive into the app for this one
* Project Manager about a clarification or "where is this in the app? Do you have examples"? 
* QA, can you show me what you mean?
* Any dev team member - I understand part of it, but have a few specific questions

But I'll be honest, sometimes I open up a chat window. Start typing my question "Hey, when you have a minute can we chat? I have a question about... because it's doing... " and then I delete it all because that helped enough

## Grab anything off the top of the sprint and dive in

Sometimes this is hard, but grabbing the top story in a sprint is a great opportunity to learn. But this does come with some caveots

Sometimes after joining a team and starting my first few stories, I ask the project manager a story they would reccommend. Mostly because I really like doing a straight forward story. There are just so many little things, how to run the app, what didn't I get setup, do I have database priveledges to find users for this, how to test the UI, what some gotchas are with the app. Asking for a good story helps prevent the "I'm still working on this" "I need help with this one again", "It's now blocked by... and ..." maybe it still happends but the scope, possible blockers are somewhat limited and that helps.

## Write things down

* Setup instructions (especially if there is a lot to it, "you'll need this and I'd reccommend installing ... and ..."
* A team member going through how to setup a code review? I favorite that url and write down some important pieces they like to see. Story number and name? Short description of what changed? Who should I mark as the reviewer?
* Test logins and how do senior devs query the database for good test accounts, with legit data?
* If QA sends you a bug, take a quick look at how they found that out. Learn from it, take some notes on what to test next time, write a unit test (if that's your jam) and go for the fix
* OneNote notebooks help organize all these little details, typically for complex stories I copy the story description into a OneNote new page and write notes about test users I used, queries I wrote to get those users, possible gotchas, or what a team member said I should check for. All little things, sometimes it's a mess and that's okay

Some of this info won't be useful in the long run, but personally I like to hit 90 day goals of being a contributing team member. Maybe it's just the sheer number of teams I've been that this has been engrained into my head. Writing things down helps me remember little details and improve on what people care about
