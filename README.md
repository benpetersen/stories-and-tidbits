## Try to dive deep before asking questions

Knowing when to ask questions is tough. 

Some team leads want you to figure it out on your own and ask a question when you ask a question. 
Some team members don't mind diving deep on a problem if you ask, going from start to finish.
Others don't mind helping, but after giving you some tips "Are you good?"

So who do you go to for help and when do you ask? Once I understand the story, I like to dive deep into the code base for 30 minutes or so, if I'm still stuck on the issue I ask my little Junimo (from Stardew Valley) or any stuffed animal (search for Rubber Duck Debugging) the really detailed question. After I jump through the obvious things and understand why I need help AND still need help understanding a portion. If that helps understand the issue or helps me understand what I'm stuck on, that's great. I'm searching for what the actual problem is. Then the question is who do you ask? 

* Lead dev? I need a deep dive into the app for this one
* Project Manager about a clarification or "where is this in the app? Do you have examples"? 
* QA, can you show me what you mean?
* Any dev team member - I understand part of it, but have a few specific questions

But I'll be honest, sometimes I open up a chat window. Start typing my question "Hey, when you have a minute can we chat? I have a question about... because it's doing... " and then I delete it all because that helped enough

## Grab anything off the top of the sprint and dive in

Sometimes this is hard, but grabbing the top story in a sprint is a great opportunity to learn. But this does come with some caveots

Sometimes after joining a team and starting my first few stories, I ask the project manager a story they would reccommend. Mostly because I really like doing a straight forward story. There are just so many little things, how to run the app, what didn't I get setup, do I have database priveledges to find users for this, how to test the UI, what some gotchas are with the app. Asking for a good story helps prevent the "I'm still working on this" "I need help with this one again", "It's now blocked by... and ..." maybe it still happends but the scope, possible blockers are somewhat limited and that helps.

## Write things down

* Setup instructions (especially if there is a lot to it, "you'll need this and I'd reccommend installing ... and ..."
* A team member going through how to setup a code review? I favorite that url and write down some important pieces they like to see. Story number and name? Short description of what changed? Who should I mark as the reviewer?
* Test logins and how do senior devs query the database for good test accounts, with legit data?
* If QA sends you a bug, take a quick look at how they found that out. Learn from it, take some notes on what to test next time, write a unit test (if that's your jam) and go for the fix
* OneNote notebooks help organize all these little details, typically for complex stories I copy the story description into a OneNote new page and write notes about test users I used, queries I wrote to get those users, possible gotchas, or what a team member said I should check for. All little things, sometimes it's a mess and that's okay

Some of this info won't be useful in the long run, but personally I like to hit 90 day goals of being a contributing team member. Maybe it's just the sheer number of teams I've been that this has been engrained into my head. Writing things down helps me remember little details and improve on what people care about

## Take care of yourself

It's weird, but few notice if you work through lunch. It's especially hazardous to think this way: "I'll take a break once I finish that issue I just found" Then after I fix that one I find a few more things I can get do. This is pretty common with small teams and if some team members are in different time zones. "Oh, it's 1pm I guess I worked through my lunch. Guess I'll start on this now". No! Stop!

* Get outside and go for a walk!
* Read a book in a quiet area of your office. 
* Listen to an audiobook or a podcast 
* Go pet your dog or give your significant other a hug  

This is something I've struggled with for years. Most managers don't really notice if you work through your lunch hour, this is especially true if you're remote. Time management is on you. This is especially true for "you time". If you work through lunch, maybe mention it to your team lead but honestly just lock your pc and take a break. More often than not, companies won't give you a promotion for burning yourself out one day at a time. 

I've also found that it's helpful to use your 2nd-3rd paycheck to upgrade a few things. Is your work station up to par? These are rather specific, but do yourself a favor and ask yourself
* Is my back comfortable? Am I slouching? 
* Do I have neck strain from craning at this laptop for 8 hours a day? Most ergonomic specialists and chiropracts believe in 90 degree angles and your head should be slightly pointed down. 
* Does this keyboard just suck? Most keyboards included with office PCs aren't great, I've had problems with my knuckles hurting after typing so much, my shoulders sloughing, and my wrists don't feel great. Ask yourself why are keyboards straight across when your fingers aren't the same length? If you dive into different keyboards notice that most mechanical keyboards aren't ergonomical either, they just have great switches. 

It's interesting, it's often on you to care about these little issues. Some employers have ergonomically trained office staff, but most say "Here is your desk". This is usually the case for software contractors, they legally aren't obligated to care because you aren't an employee. I sometimes try it out for a day or two, ask my manager "is it okay if I" or "Have you ever had back pain sitting at the desk? I think the keyboard is too high". You don't want submit requests for everything under the sun, but sometimes you need to care about yourself

But if your employer doesn't let you change out your desk (this can be for many reasons, being a contractor is a common one)
* Find some 8.5x11 stacks of printer paper (still in the paper exterior) and put your monitor below that.
* Buy a better keyboard (see below) and bring it home with you, leaving the usb cable at work
* Buy a closed ear headset so you don't have to hear the office noises.
* Print out some photos using their printer and make the area more enjoyable


If you WFH
* Try to find a resonable standing desk with 2 monitor arms, and a laptop stand and a keyboard tray. Uplift desk is nice but there are other stable desks
* I'd recommend an ergnomic keyboard called "ErgoDox EZ" with Cherry Brown switches. You can separate the keyboards equal distance with your shoulders, add custom keys like Undo, F5, F12, tab etc in parts of the keyboard you want. 
* Buy some large photo frames from Ikea, prints from Costco photo center or even some plants from a nursery and make your office space more inviting. 

This goes as far as thinking about future you. I've covered taking lunches, thinking about your posture but I want to bring up investing because I want to retire at some point. Do "future you" a favor and invest. I know, it's dumb, you've been told to do it. But no one makes you, HR just makes you fill out a form "Are you a 0, 1 or 2?" "Here's something to help you figure that out" And legally, I doubt they can suggest this, but sign up. Make it as automatic as possible. There are a lot of guides on 401ks, Roth IRAs for retirement that you can look at, but try to hit 10% of your income. But at a mimumum if your employer does a 401k match put that much in to start.

A few other ideas
* Over time try to up this to 10-15%. If you get a raise, increase the % you put in to match that raise. It's actually really easy (if you can afford it)
* Keep an eye on the costs of the fund. Is it a flat fee per month or a percent? Fees can really add up, usually picking a total stock market index / S&P 500 fund is a good starting off point
* Does your company match your 401k?
* Does your company offer a HSA?
* Assume that you never had this money, it's not yours, it's for future you!

These things help lower your income tax bracket, lowering that, lowers the amount of taxes you have to pay that year and helps future you.
